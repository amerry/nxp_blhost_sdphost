blhost_sdphost
==============

This repository combines the NXP blhost release and the sdphost sources from
the i.MXRT sdk into one place you can type 'make' and have them pop out.

On macOS, open proj/blhost.xcodeproj in Xcode and build it. The binaries will
be available in proj/Build/Products/Release.
